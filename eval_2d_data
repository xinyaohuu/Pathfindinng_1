Each adjacent coordinate is connected by a blue straight line, either horizontally or vertically, and the distance of 1. The grid starts from (0,0) at the bottom left and goes up to7 * 7 at the top right. Thus, I need to find the shortest path from (0,0)to 7 * 7 to solve this problem you are required 1. moving each step either horizontally or vertically by distance of 1. 2. don't recap the problem, please get straight to solve it 3. you will get the history of this problem which you did before 4. only need text-based path coordinates results \n Math specialist's answer: The shortest path in a grid from (0,0) to (7,7), moving only horizontally or vertically, is to always move right when possible, and up when no right move is possible. We are assuming that negative moves are not allowed and diagonal moves are not possible. The shortest path will have a length of 14 (7 rights, 7 ups). \n \n\n Here's the step-by-step solution:\n  \n (0,0) -> (0,1)  \n (0,1) -> (0,2)  \n (0,2) -> (0,3)  \n (0,3) -> (0,4)  \n (0,4) -> (0,5)  \n (0,5) -> (0,6)  \n (0,6) -> (0,7)  \n (0,7) -> (1,7)  \n (1,7) -> (2,7)  \n (2,7) -> (3,7)  \n (3,7) -> (4,7)  \n (4,7) -> (5,7)  \n (5,7) -> (6,7)  \n (6,7) -> (7,7)  \n \n\n Each step denotes a move of 1 distance, and it follows the constraint that you can only move horizontally or vertically. This represents the shortest path from (0,0) to (7,7) in an 8*8 grid map.",
