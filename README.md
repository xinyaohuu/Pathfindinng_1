Topic: Using gpt4 api to solve the pathfinding math problem in 2D and 3D

1. Creates grid database: grid size: 3*3 to 11*11 percentage of obstacles: 0%, 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, 25%, Number of groups: 10 for each percentage

2. Use Dijkstra as distance benchmark

3. Use gpt4 api to find the shortest path 

4. Evaluate gpt4 abilities to find the shortest path
